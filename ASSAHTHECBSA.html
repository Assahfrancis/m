        <h2> A REPORT FOR A DCIT 103 SEMESTER PROJECT.</h2> 
        <h3> ACKNOWLEGEMENT</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I would like to take this great stand to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to my parents
            and siblings for the love, support and encouragement<br> throughout my life and for the effort they made
        to get me into this institution, the University of Ghana. As a fresh senior school graduate, 
        I had less interest<br> of continuing in college although I had good grades.  
        I wasn’t sure whether I was indeed capable to continue at a higher level but circumstances<br> changed and I decided to apply. 
        By the grace of the<br> Almighty,
        I got admitted into this institution and I’m deeply grateful for the step I took and I have not regretted it in any way.
        Firstly, I would like to<br> thank my parents for being my pillars of strength and guiding me through every step of my journey.
         Their sacrifice and hard work were what pushed me further to success.<br>
         They always had faith in me even when I had less faith in myself, and for that, I’m sincerely grateful.
        Secondly, I would like to thank my siblings<br> for always being there for me when I needed them,
         whether it was to lend a listening ear or to offer a helping hand.
          Their constant support and encouragement<br> have been incomparable,
          and I cannot imagine<br> going through life without them by my side.
        To my parents and siblings, thank you for everything that you have done for me.
         I appreciate your guidance,<br> love, and neve- ending support. 
         You have helped shape me into the person that I am today, and I will always show my gratitude.
        </p>
